# intel_inhouse_rankings
in(tel)houses

Before running (you can run all), here's what you have to change:

1) make sure you have access to the inhouse_game_data shared folder and your gdrive is mounted

2) api_key: might need to refresh a new riot api key

3) make sure guest_list is populated with any non-intel players

4) make any updates to PLAYER_ROLE_PREF as desired

5) make sure tournament_code is the code used in the previous inhouse game, and ign is the summoner name of someone that played in that game

6) run all -> share outputs as desired, use matchmaking tool for next game. don't forget to use battlefy or something to generate new tourney code
